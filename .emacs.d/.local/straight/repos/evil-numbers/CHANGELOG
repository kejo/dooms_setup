0.5
	- Add support for block selections
  - Add support for subscript and superscript numbers
  - Make padding optinal
  - Fix numbers being pushed out of selections (e.g. calling inc-at-pt on ^9 9$
    where ^$ denote the start and end of the selection would result in 10 9).
  - Pad negative numbers and add a plus sign if a negative number is turned into
    a positive number (if padding is enabled)
  - Add g C-a like functionality (i.e. increment first number in selection by 1,
    second one by 2 and so on)
